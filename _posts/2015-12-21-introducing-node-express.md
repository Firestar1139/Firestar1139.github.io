### Overview

Node.js is a set of Javascript tools you can use to create web based applications including web pages.  You create templates for your web pages in "HTML on steroids" that allows you to inject information dynamically into your pages.  You also write scripts in javascript to obtain and process information you want to display on your web pages.

We will be using a Node.js package called "express" to help us create our web site.  Watch [This Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMIyTH9wSg) to see an example of creating a website using express.  You might not understand everything, but it will give a sense of how express works.

### Homework

Log into c9.io, open your NBAStats workspace, and change the text of the main page (index.html) from "Express Welcome to Express" to "Welcome to my NBA Stats page".  Start the server ("Run") and visit your web page from a browser.

### What's next 

Next time we will learn how to fetch some data and format it for display on your web page.
